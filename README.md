## Overview

9c-launcher is a game launcher to run [Nine Chronicles](https://github.com/planetarium/NineChronicles), with embedded private key management & NCG wallet capabilities.
The launcher is written in Typescript, and uses GraphQL, Electron, React.

## Features
- Game execution and update, with multiple release channel support.
- Automatically selects optimized RPC server for user's network
- Private key creation, import from QR code or raw secp256k1 key, encrypt using [Web3 Secret Storage](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/data-structures-and-encoding/web3-secret-storage/) specs.
- [NCG](https://gold.nine-chronicles.com/) wallet: Send NCG to other addresses or swap to WNCG.
- Supports Windows, macOS, Linux.

## Setup
> **Note**
> The repository is under refactor process, v2 changes will be still migrated, but if you want to participate in new version, but if you want to participate ongoing refactoring check out [v3/dev](https://github.com/planetarium/9c-launcher/tree/v3/dev) and related branches.

First, install all dependencies required for development.

```bash
yarn
```

After, run the following command.

```bash
yarn codegen
yarn dev
```

## Development

The basic frontend has `webpack-hot-reload`, which automatically reflects code changes.
Developing the renderer process does not require electron relaunch. However, when there's a change in the main process, electron relaunch is required.

## Build

```bash
yarn
yarn codegen
yarn build  # development build
yarn build-prod  # production build
```

## Packaging
> **Note**
> This section hasn't been used in production and it's likely outdated.

```bash
# generate/sign a new APV with the given private key and pack
APV_SIGN_KEY=... yarn pack-all
# generate/sign a specific APV with the given private key and pack
APV_SIGN_KEY=... APV_NO=1234 yarn pack-all
# pack with the given APV
APV=... yarn pack-all
# pack without APV (for reusing the APV of the latest release)
yarn pack-all
```

Packaging requires the following environment variables. If both the `APV` and `APV_SIGN_KEY` are ommited,
APV(App Protocol Version) signing will not take place.

- `APV`: APV token
  ([`Libplanet.Net.AppProtocolVersion.Token`][appprotocolversion.token]).
  If an APV is provided, the other environment variables will be ignored and the build and packaged app will be configured to use that `APV`.
- `APV_SIGN_KEY`: Hexadecimal string of the private key used for APV signing
- `APV_NO`: APV number
  ([`Libplanet.Net.AppProtocolVersion.Version`][appprotocolversion.version]).
  When ommited, packaging will automatically use [download.nine-chronicles.com](https://download.nine-chronicles.com/)'s latest version number plus 1.

[appprotocolversion.token]: https://docs.libplanet.io/master/api/Libplanet.Net.AppProtocolVersion.html#Libplanet_Net_AppProtocolVersion_Token
[appprotocolversion.version]: https://docs.libplanet.io/master/api/Libplanet.Net.AppProtocolVersion.html#Libplanet_Net_AppProtocolVersion_Version

### Replacing config.json content after packaging
> **Note**
> This section hasn't been used in production and it's likely outdated.

For replacing the configuration content of _config.json_ in the already packed _Windows.zip_ or _macOS.tar.gz_, it's convenient to use the _scripts/extract-config.sh_ and _scripts/replace-config.sh_ scripts.

```bash
# extract config.json content from package (supports Windows.zip and macOS.tar.gz)
scripts/extract-config.sh path/Windows.zip > config.json
# replace config.json content in package (supports Windows.zip and macOS.tar.gz)
scripts/replace-config.sh path/Windows.zip < config.json
```

### Packaging with electron-builder
Note that building with electron-builder is experimental.

```bash
# Windows (nsis)
# macOS (dmg, zip)
yarn pack-all:electron-builder
```

## Log Path

Logs are saved in the following paths:

```
- on macOS: ~/Library/Logs/Nine Chronicles/{process type}.log
- on Windows: %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\Nine Chronicles\logs\{process type}.log
```
